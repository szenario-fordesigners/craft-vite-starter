[Craft](https://craftcms.com/) is a flexible, user-friendly CMS for creating custom digital experiences on the web and beyond.

In technical terms, it’s a self-hosted PHP application backed by a MySQL or Postgres database. Read more in the [official documentation](https://craftcms.com/docs).

:postal_horn: **If you just heard about Craft:** Take a feature tour on [our website](https://craftcms.com/features)—then spin up a [demo project](https://craftcms.com/demo) to try it out for yourself.

:construction_worker_woman: **If you are eager to start building:** You’re in exactly the right place!

## Getting Started

This repository is a bare-bones [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) “project”, intended for use with the `composer create-project` command. It contains only the folders and files absolutely required to run Craft.

> **Note**  
> Our [tutorial](https://craftcms.com/docs/getting-started-tutorial/) covers the setup process in greater depth. If you get stuck, give it a once-over; if things still aren’t clicking, help is never far away in [our community](https://craftcms.com/community) or via [official support](https://craftcms.com/support-services).

The best way to spin up your first project is with [DDEV](https://ddev.com/), a cross-platform, Docker-based PHP development environment. Follow our [quick-start instructions](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/install.html) to get up and running, then check out [next steps](https://craftcms.com/docs/5.x/install.html#next-steps)!
